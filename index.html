                    I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior knowledge in software development.
                    However,
                    within a few weeks, I was able to grasp the crux of software development and also master the soft
                    skills
                    required for being a software developer.
                    So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing push in my career as a software
                    developer.

                    immense learning that was really different from the self learning I started with. The learning was
                    fun
                    and there were some internship job opportunities that were presented to us. I got my first gig

                    Thank you Tech Studio for that push I needed.</p>

                    solutions.
                </p>
